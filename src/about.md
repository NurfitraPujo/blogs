Heya, nice to meet you! I deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications a.k.a <span class="text-primary">**Software Engineer**</span>. As an engineer, i love using ruby and javascript. Why? personal preference! heheeh, i mean i love the expressiveness and maturity of ruby, but well i think we can agree that its ecosystem is not as massive as javascript. I do aspire to become one of the person to contribute on the growth of ruby.

About me? well, can't say much about myself. I'm an INFP and that means i value uniqueness, and my friends do say that i have my own quirks. Another thing i value is respect and emphaty. As a software engineer i often find myself get stuck and burned out, feeling like i'm going circles without improvement. But as it turns out the improvements is there, i just not noticing it.

You have some cool projects that needs some collaborator / contributor? do <span class="text-primary">**[email](mailto:fitrapujo@gmail.com)**</span> me!
